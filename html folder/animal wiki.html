    <h1>Ants</h1>
        <p> Ants are small colony based insects from the Formicidae family. Ants originated in the Cretaceous and evolved into many other species from then. Today more than 12,500 different species of ants have been discovered.
	Ant colonies can range from tens of ants to millions of ants. Ant colonies typically consist of drones, workers, soldiers, and a queen.
	Ants inhabit every continent except for Antarctica and are believed to make up roughly 20% of land based biomass.</p>

        Taxonomy
        </h2>
        <p>
        	Ants evolved from a lineage within the stinging wasps, and a 2013 study suggests that they are a sister group of the Apoidea. In 1966, E. O. Wilson and his colleagues identified the fossil remains of an ant (Sphecomyrma) that lived in the Cretaceous period. The specimen, trapped in amber dating back to around 92 million years ago, has features found in some wasps, but not found in modern ants. Sphecomyrma was possibly a ground forager, while Haidomyrmex and Haidomyrmodes, related genera in subfamily Sphecomyrminae, are reconstructed as active arboreal predators. Older ants in the genus Sphecomyrmodes have been found in 99 million year-old amber from Myanmar.</p>
         <p> A 2006 study suggested that ants arose tens of millions of years earlier than previously thought, up to 168 million years ago. After the rise of flowering plants about 100 million years ago they diversified and assumed ecological dominance around 60 million years ago. Some groups, such as the Leptanillinae and Martialinae, are suggested to have diversified from early primitive ants that were likely to have been predators underneath the surface of the soil. </p>

       <div class="biotext"> <p>
        	Ants are distinct in their morphology from other insects in having elbowed antennae, metapleural glands, and a strong constriction of their second abdominal segment into a node-like petiole. The head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments (formally tagmata). The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma (thorax plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and gaster (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole). The petiole may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or the second and third abdominal segments).

        Ecology
        </h2>
        <p>
        Complex nests are built by many ant species, but other species are nomadic and do not build permanent structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests may be found in the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter, and ants carefully select their nest sites; Temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests at the first sign of threats.

        Behavior
        </h2>
        <p>
        Ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants.

        Relationship with Humans
        </h2>
        <p>
        Ants have a pretty poor reputation with humans. They are mostly seen as annoying pests that are really good at getting everywhere. However, ants are more than just little creatures that want to ruin your kitchen, in some cultures ants are a delicacy or used as a condiment. People also keep ants as pets within ant farms.
